FAQ

    - The Provider you are using.
    - The query.
    - The settings (screen shot is fine, please upload it to http://imgur.com/)
    - The error message (screen shot also fine)

Q6: I got a lot of skipped files when do batch download!
A6: It is caused of the target filename is already exists. Add %md5% in your filename format.

Q7: How to login to Gelbooru/Sankaku/get cookie value?
A7: Follow this step:
    1. Press F12 on your Chrome browser and select Network tab.
    2. Go to the booru site and login.
    3. Click one of the entry and copy the Cookie value from the Request Header. 
       For gelbooru, it should like this: user_id=<number>; pass_hash=<long string>
       For sankaku, paste the whole cookie string.
       For shimmie based board, shm_user=<username; shm_session=<long string>
    4. Paste the Cookie value to the Username field.
    5. Set Login Type to Cookie. Refer to http://i.imgur.com/rCCjnPs.png
	6. Ensure the User-Agent from the browser also matching with User-Agent in the Settings tab.

Q8: Downloading tags.xml from Sankaku is too slow, what I can do?
A8: Sankaku doesn't allow to download the tags json/xml directly, so the application need to
    parse each individual tag pages, which over 16k pages. To avoid this, the application can
    reparse the tags again so it can get the actual tag type from the post page itself.
    To enable it:
    1. Disable "Use Global Tags.xml" in the settings page.
    2. The actual tags type will be displayed after the post is added to the download list 
       (together with image url resolution).
    3. For batch download, the tags will be reparsed just before the actual download.
    The disadvantage of this feature:
    1. Tags autocomplete might not working or show incorrect value, as it depends on local 
       tags.xml.
    2. Wrong tags type will be displayed before the image url is resolved, as it depends on 
       local tags.xml.

Q8: Sankaku only download maximum 500 images/20 pages? Why the application doesn't download all images? etc.
A8: You need to supply the login information, see Q7.
